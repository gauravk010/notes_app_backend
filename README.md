## Deployment

Back-end of the Notes App is deployed on Render.

**Note: I'm using Render for my Backend, and it is a free web service that goes 15 minutes without receiving inbound traffic. So, please be patient if the website's API keeps loading, wait and just reload the website after one minute, as it takes up to a minute to restart the service.**
